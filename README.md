# MSLearnPython
This repository is used to log what I learned python from the free Microsoft course

The course website: https://aka.ms/MSLearnPython

You can also get the sample code from : https://aka.ms/PythonGettingStarted

But I wrote some sample code by meself what I was learning it.

There would be some different with the course, because I simplied some of them

to reduce unnecessary part when you are learning python.

E.g. It's not necessary to create Azure account and use the API they provided when you are learning python.
